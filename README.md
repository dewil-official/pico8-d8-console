## ðŸ’¥ Pico-8 Fantasy Console

This project is made in the "pico-8" fantasy console, get it for cheap [here](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

> PICO-8 is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a shell for typing in Lua commands and provides simple built-in tools for creating your own cartridges.

## ðŸš— D8-Concept

This started out as a school-project, we're using "pico-8" there (which is pretty cool).

The idea behind this is to create a custom-made fantasy console named **d8**, which I'll use for a custom 3d-printed handheld-console and ALSO for a custom made **car-console**.

**Car-console** at this point means, that a small screen with NES styled controller will be placed on the co-driver side, so my co-drivers can battle for the highest score in my self made minigames.

Maybe, at some point, there'll be a second console in the back of my car, that provides a local multiplayer for two persons.

## ðŸ’¡ Contribute

The main reason I'm sharing this here is because I want that version control.

However, I'll really appreciate it if you want to contribute. You're free to upload your own minigames, as well as improve my code. You may also improve some of my textures etc. Keep in mind that this is my first pico-8 project and not every problem is solved ideally.

Thanks for reading! ðŸ˜‹
